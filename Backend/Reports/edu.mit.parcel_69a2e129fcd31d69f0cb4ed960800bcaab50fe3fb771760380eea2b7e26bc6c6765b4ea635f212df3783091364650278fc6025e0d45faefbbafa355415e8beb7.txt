------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Critical] <Debug> Android Debug Mode Checking:
           DEBUG mode is ON(android:debuggable="true") in AndroidManifest.xml. This is very dangerous. The attackers will be able to sniffer
           the debug messages by Logcat. Please disable the DEBUG mode if it is a released application.
[Critical] <Debug> Android Debug Certificate Checking:
           App is signed with debug certificate, indicating that debug mode may be enabled. This could potentially be dangerous if used in
           production environments.
[Warning] <Sensitive_Information> Getting IMEI and Device ID:
           This app has code getting the "device id(IMEI)" but there are problems with this "TelephonyManager.getDeviceId()" approach.
               1.Non-phones: Wifi-only devices or music players that don't have telephony hardware just don't have this kind of unique
           identifier.
               2.Persistence: On devices which do have this, it persists across device data wipes and factory resets. It's not clear at all
           if, in this situation, your app should regard this as the same device.
               3.Privilege:It requires READ_PHONE_STATE permission, which is irritating if you don't otherwise use or need telephony.
               4.Bugs: We have seen a few instances of production phones for which the implementation is buggy and returns garbage, for
           example zeros or asterisks.
               If you want to get an unique id for the device, we suggest you use "Installation" framework in the following article.
               Please check the reference: http://android-developers.blogspot.tw/2011/03/identifying-app-installations.html

[Notice]  AndroidManifest Adb Backup Checking:
           ADB Backup is ENABLED for this app (default: ENABLED). ADB Backup is a good tool for backing up all of your files. If it's open
           for this app, people who have your phone can copy all of the sensitive data for this app in your phone (Prerequisite: 1.Unlock
           phone's screen 2.Open the developer mode). The sensitive data may include lifetime access token, username or password, etc.
